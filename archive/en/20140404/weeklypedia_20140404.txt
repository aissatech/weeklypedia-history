The WEEKLYPEDIA: Issue 3, April 4, 2014 (English Wikipedia Edition)

Hello again! After our not-so-brief hiatus, Weeklypedia is back and better than ever. How has Weeklypedia improved you ask? Here's the short version:

  + New sections! "New Articles" highlights articles created within the last week. "Statistics" summarizes some numbers for you quants out there.
  + Archives! The most-frequently requested feature, a non-email version for easy linkage and reference. View them here: http://weekly.hatnote.com/archive.html
  + More accurate! We've discovered and squared away a couple inconsistencies in the old rollup algorithms.
  + Diffs! Articles are accompanied with links for a merged diff of all the changes to the article during that week.
  + Robustification! Weeklypedia now reacts much better to Wikipedia database downtime and other availability issues.
  + Full automation! The first trial issues of Weeklypedia were manual affairs. No longer!

This new Weeklypedia's automation should ensure timely and reliable delivery for all Weeklypedians. Thanks for bearing with us, enjoy this week's issue, and continue to forward widely!
