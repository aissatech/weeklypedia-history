Hello again! After a precarious wait, Weeklypedia is back and better
than ever. How has Weeklypedia improved you ask? Here's the short version:

<ul>
<li><b>New sections!</b> "New Articles" highlights articles created
within the last week. "Statistics" summarizes some numbers for you
quants out there.</li>
<li><b>Archives!</b> The most-frequently requested feature, a
non-email version for easy linkage and reference. 
<a href="http://weekly.hatnote.com/archive.html">View them here.</a></li>
<li><b>More accurate!</b> We've discovered and squared away a couple
inconsistencies in the rollups.</li>
<li><b>Robustified!</b> Weeklypedia now reacts much better to
Wikipedia database downtime and other availability issues.</li>
<li><b>Fully automated!</b> The first trial issues of Weeklypedia were
manual affairs.</li> 
</ul>

Just to be extra-clear. In spite of the lengthy gap between alpha and
beta versions, the new version's automation should ensure timely
regular delivery for all Weeklypedians. Thanks for bearing with us and
continue to forward widely!
